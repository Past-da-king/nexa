# Project Improvement Suggestions

Here is a list of potential improvements for the Nexus application:

1. **Code Cleanup (String Resources):** All hardcoded text in the UI (button labels, screen titles, status messages) should be moved into a central `strings.xml` resource file. This is a best practice for Android development that makes the app easier to maintain and translate.

2. **QR Code Connecting:** The UI and logic for connecting via QR code can be implemented. This would involve adding a button to show the user's QR code and an option to scan another user's code.
