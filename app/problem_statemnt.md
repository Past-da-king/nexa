Rural and township communities face significant challenges related to poor or intermittent internet 
connectivity. Mainstream social networking platforms assume constant online access, which systematically 
excludes millions from meaningful digital participation. 
This capstone project will develop Nexa, a mobile app that enables decentralized peer-to-peer social 
networking in rural and township communities where internet access is limited or unreliable. Nexa will 
support offline messaging, group chats (“community channels”), and multimedia sharing using Bluetooth, 
Wi-Fi Direct, and delay-tolerant networking, allowing messages to hop through nearby devices until they 
reach their destination. Users will create local identities without phone numbers or email addresses, and all 
communication will be secured with end-to-end encryption. Discovery of nearby peers will occur 
automatically via proximity-based scanning and manually via QR codes. All data will be encrypted and stored 
locally on the device, with optional cloud syncing when internet access is available. The app will prioritize 
accessibility, offering intuitive navigation and support for voice messaging. 
Development will use Kotlin for Android, low-level networking protocols for device-to-device 
communication, and cryptographic libraries such as libsodium or the Signal Protocol for security.
